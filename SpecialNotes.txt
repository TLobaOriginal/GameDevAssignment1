========================================
SPECIAL NOTES
========================================
Upon descending, if the speed at which we go down is greater the one, there is a chance that the line gets bypassed.
Many ways to fix this
- Currently, the y change be -1 and not 1
- I could also see if the centre of the player is beyond a certain point and jerk them back but that can be a bit jarring.
